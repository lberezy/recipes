####Method

1. Place the first 7 ingredients (half the chilli and half the spring onion) into a mortar and pestle and crush into a fine paste. Preheat oven to 120 degrees Celcius.
2. In a 1.5 L or greater sized casserole dish with lid, fry the crushed paste in ~30 mL of vegetable or other high temperature oil for 1-2 minutes over medium heat. Do not burn.
3. Place all beef cheeks in the dish with the fried paste and coat liberally. Brown the beef cheeks over medium-high heat, turning regularly to encourage Maillard reactions.
4. Add all the remaining ingredients except for the corriander leaves, peanuts and brown sugar to the dish, cover and place in the oven for 6-10 hours.
5. Toast peanuts over low heat. Prepare corriander leaves, remaining finely sliced chilli and spring onion to garnish.
6. Remove the beef cheek pieces and keep in an insulated container. Reduce sauce over medium heat until approximately 300 mL remains. Add brown sugar. Spoon sauce reduction over meat.
7. Serve meat with garnish of corriander, sliced chilli and spring onion with toasted peanuts. Remaining suace reduction may be served as a condiment.
